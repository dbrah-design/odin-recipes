    <h1>Ranch Chicken Tacos</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These ranch chicken tacos are a great change from regular Mexican-style tacos. A quick, cool summer dinner made with
            leftover rotisserie chicken. Naturally, you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just be sure to
            shred it for real tacos.</p>
        <ul>

            <li>1/2 cup ranch dressing</li>
            <li>1/4 cup reduced-fat sour cream</li>
            <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon mild chunky salsa</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
            <li>8 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
            <li>shredded lettuce</li>
            <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) can sliced black olives</li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>

        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add tortellini. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tortellini
                float to the top and the filling is hot, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir chicken breast in hot oil until no longer pink
                in the center, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in another skillet over medium heat; cook and stir mushrooms and garlic powder until mushrooms begin to
                soften, about 3 minutes. Stir heavy cream into mushrooms and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer
                until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Add Parmesan cheese, parsley, and salt. Continue to cook until cheese is
                melted, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Stir tortellini and chicken into mushroom-cream sauce. Simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
